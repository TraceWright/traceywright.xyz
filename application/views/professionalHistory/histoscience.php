	My experience with Zenith Pathology began with a role in administration. I processed test request forms, entering patient details, gp and/or surgery information, and billing information. 
</p><p>
	After a couple of months, a position became available in the laboratory and I progressed to performing anatomical pathology cut up, including verbally dictating macroscopic descriptions of specimens to audio recordings. The sample types were predominantly skins, with some GI tissue, and also larger organs under indirect supervision of a pathologist. I was involved with chemical tissue processing and the maintenance of tissue processing equipment.
</p><p>
	During down times, I took the initiative to practise microtomy with practise blocks. I approached experience staff for tips on technique, and observed various people and their individual methods. This allowed me refine my skills to become competent and comfortable with tissue sectioning before I progressed to sectioning patient samples. Once I moved on to patient samples, I found the work to be rhythmic and enjoyable. I became competent in block facing, tissue sectioning for standard samples, as well as for special stains and immunohistochemistry.

        This is a BPM process model of the histopathology lab process for patient samples and administrative documentation. The scope of this model extends only to tasks that I have performed personally.
