		My interest for IT first developed through my love of learning. In 2013, as a recent biomedical science honours graduate, I had to make some choices about how I wanted my career to proceed. After much consideration, I decided to place my bets on a Master's degree in IT. I enrolled at QUT, and took a unit in fundamental programming, another in business process improvement, and I was away. Admiteddly, at first I was really out of my depth. I had no real experience with programming, and really only had the limited IT skills I'd developed throughout my work and prior education, and there I was doing a IT Master's degree. I mitigated the risks I faced by taking only one or two courses at a time, and this allowed me the extra time I needed to delve deeper into topics, which helped to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. I had experienced people to support my learning, made good use of the resources around me, selected courses strategically, and held onto hope that it would all come together and make sense at some point.

		During winter break of 2015, I decided to build my first PC. I spent weeks researching components, looking into things like how much RAM and I wanted and which motherboard would support which type of RAM. Eventually, I settled on a specific list of components I'd selected, and went about making the purchase through my local <a href="http://www.msy.com.au/">MSY</a> retailer (Figure 1).

		I'd never built a PC from components before, and due to some recent changes in my close social circle, I didn't have anyone with technical experience to support me through the process of putting it all together. I watched some YouTube videos on how it's done, and very carefully began the build (Figure 3). I recall that at one point, when I wasn't precisely clear about which lead plugged into which socket, I spent more than an hour reading into how it should be done. I wasn't taking any chances on trial and error, I didn't want to fry my system before I'd even switched it on. It took a full day, and in the end I successfully switched on my new PC for the first time (Figure 2).

		Building a PC was a great experience for more reasons than one. I thoroughly enjoyed the process and love my PC to this day. The 32" screen is great for multi-tasking, as are the quad cores and 16 GB of RAM. I often run mutliple VM's with no performance issues at all. My goal was to make my office a great place to be so there would be nothing preventing me from wanting to be at my computer studying, programming, and learning, and I have certainly achieved that. I also gained further insight into the inner-workings of a PC through the design and build process, and this has been invaluable for my general IT knowledge.

		The more I study IT, the more interesting it becomes. Every project and uni course I complete gives me more confidence and ability, which further encourages me into the next challenge. This current web development project is similarly rewarding. Each individual coding challenge I overcome is a step closer to becoming a 'Master' programmer, which is the end goal. I think I've made the right decision in taking my time with this degree. The most important thing to me is to be great at what I do, and given that I don't have a IT bachelor degree, I needed time to work through the broad range of IT concepts that are required for success. IT has truly become a hobby for me. I literally spend my spare time working on IT projects and reading IT news. I'm hoping that these positive experiences will lead me into the next stage of my career, and intend to pursue this as a goal.

		I've played around with an Arduino microcontroller, starting with some simple light programs (Figure 5) which helped me to learn the fundamental connections required for power and data transfer. Earlier this year, when I was studying mobile app development at uni, I ordered some additional components for my Arduino including Bluetooth and an infrared thermometer. The idea is to take a person's temperature then send the data via Bluetooth to a server, then to an app. I connected the Bluetooth, and it appeared to be functioning, but the project was put on the backburner behind higher priority uni work. Hopefully I'll get a chance to pick up this project again sometime soon.
