	<p>
		I'm currently building this website to further improve upon my programming skills with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL, and thought I'd also use this as an opportunity to demonstrate the broad range of skills I've acquired throughout my professional and academic career. The website has been built using CodeIgniter's LAMP stack, which is a free, open-source web service solution that combines the Linux operating system; Apache HTTP Server; MySQL RDBMS; and the PHP programming language in a pre-packaged bundle.

		This is a step forward from the websites I've built in the past, which were rather basic in function. I'm learning more about the intricate workings of PHP such as how the controller is used to pass around data, and how to get the most out of a few lines of code by using arrays. I've been using models to do SQL queries that allow data to be received from a mobile app, and passed to views. I'm also really interested to know more about JavaScript plugins, and how I can best leverage these tools to get more dynamic features for my website. I've had my first experiences with GitHub earlier this year, and am keen to get stuck into mastering that (hopefully with cmd rather than just gui!) by versioning my code there also.

		I've envisioned this website to be a collation of programming features that will showcase both my skills as a programmer, and content-wise, my experiences as a biomedical research/medical laboratory scientist. Feel free to browse through and see what I've been up to!

		My technical support person for this project (and others) is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-hovington-21b1254b">Luke Hovington</a> , who has been so helpful with solving problems that are out of my depth and require advanced IT skills. He's super patient, he lets me drive (the keyboard and mouse), and he takes the time to help me understand the problem and how to solve it. Also, his extensive IT experience has helped to match me with the products I need to develop my goals and ideas into reality. Thanks so much Luke, there will be more BBQ's and pie coming your way!
