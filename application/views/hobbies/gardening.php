	At the beginning of Spring in 2014, I decided that I wanted to give some time to being a 'green thumb'. It was all triggered by a bargain pick-up of some potted flowers at my local Woolies. They had a whole bunch of potted daisies that were close to their end, so they were selling them off cheap. I took home a couple of dozen of them and brought them back to their former glory with a little TLC. I then decided to give them a permanent home in a garden I created in our back yard. That's how it all began!

	<br><br>

	Pictured right is one of my favourite roses which I owned long before I created all the gardens you'll see in the galleries below. This, and a couple of other colour varieties, was a gift that I received one Valentine's Day. I adore this colour. Peaches are one of my favourite fruits and the colour of this rose reminds me of delicious peach.

	Coming home to beautiful flowers like this, then spending half an hour standing out with the hose watering everything and finding new blossoms along the way is a great way to wind down at the end of a day.

	The aforementioned daisies make their way into the backyard ground, then a whole bunch of other plants from my local Bunnings followed. Making this happen required a little bit of hard work with a shovel, but I thoroughly enjoyed the process, especially when the flowers came into bloom and brought beautiful, vivid colours into my yard.

	<br><br>

	The old tree trunk stub served as a pot of sorts for the first daisy plant, which I thought was a great way to bring new life to something old. Some time after I planted the daisy, little mushrooms began to grow around the base of the trunk! So cute! Before long, I had the area along the fence full. I lined the garden with some timber from our firewood stash, and got in some mulch to protect the flowers from the upcoming summer heat. A touch of wall art and some solar lights finished up the garden work, and I would sit by the BBQ in the evenings looking at the pretty flowers whilst I cooked dinner enjoying the view of my colourful yard.

	During summer of 2014, I got some treated timber (the non-toxic kind) from my local timber supplier, and put together this vege box. I had some help from a friend with a drill for the assembly, but the rest was all me. I dug up some of the backyard soil to give the vege roots the best possible chance of working their way through the deeper soil, then loaded in a trailer-full of soil. After mixing through a few bags of cow poo to give the soil some extra micro-nutrients, my seedlings went in. 

	<br><br>

	As you can see, the tomato plants started out as teeny tiny seedlings. Before long, I had to get some wire framing in to support the branches and their heavy tomatoes. The yield was good, and tasted absolutely delicious! There's nothing like freshly picked veg that's gone straight from garden to plate. Made me realise how tasteless the supermarket food is. In addition to the tomatoes and zucchinis pictured, I had squash, cabbage, capsicum, lettuce, beetroot, corn, and more!

	Upon discovering a rusty, old wheelbarrow decomposing behind the garden shed, my creative mind decided to make something of it. A touch of rustproof spraypaint would hopefully slow the rusting process, and there was no need to create holes for water drainage in the base of the barrow because they already existed. This piece added even more character to my yard!
